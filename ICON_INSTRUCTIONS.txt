ICON SETUP FOR PWA
==================

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add two icon images:

REQUIRED ICONS:
---------------
1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

HOW TO CREATE ICONS:
--------------------
Option 1 - Use an online tool:
  - Visit: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
  - Upload a square image (at least 512x512)
  - It will generate all required sizes
  - Download and place in the 'static' folder

Option 2 - Create manually:
  - Create a square image with a microphone/podcast icon
  - Use Photoshop, GIMP, or Canva
  - Export as PNG in two sizes: 192x192 and 512x512
  - Save as icon-192.png and icon-512.png in the 'static' folder

Option 3 - Use a temporary placeholder:
  - You can use any square PNG image as a temporary icon
  - Rename them to icon-192.png and icon-512.png

ICON DESIGN TIPS:
-----------------
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Include a microphone, headphones, or podcast wave symbol
- Match your app's purple gradient theme (#667eea to #764ba2)
- Make sure text is readable at small sizes
- Use a solid background color or simple gradient

WHERE TO PLACE:
---------------
Place both icon files in:
c:\Users\thars\OneDrive\Desktop\agentic ai\github\visual studio\podcastapp\static\

The app will work without icons, but users won't see a custom app icon when they install it.
